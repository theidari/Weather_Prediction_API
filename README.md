### Overview of Project

This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

#### Objective:
Data Cleaning:

create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
Summary Statistic:

Create a dataframe of summary statistics (Methods: ➊ groupby ➋ aggregation) including:
A row for each drug regimen.
A column for each of the following statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume.
Generate bar charts that show the number of mice tested for each drug regimen and pie charts that show the distribution of females versus males with both Pandas DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot methods.
Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot for the four treatment groups, Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
Generate line plot is generated that shows the tumor volume vs. time point for one mouse treated with Capomulin.
Generate scatter plot is generated that shows the average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen And Calculate Correlation and Regression.
Methods and Software:
The analyses were performed using the Resources dataset. and correlation checked by Linear Reression method.
